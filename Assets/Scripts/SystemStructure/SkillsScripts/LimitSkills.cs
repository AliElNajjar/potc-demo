     *         Limits are special skills that don’t cost any MP to use, 
     *         and become available by fulfilling certain conditions. 
     *         Similar to Passive skills, Limits are obtained naturally by leveling up, 
     *         with a few being obtainable by other means. Until a unit unlocks their first Limit,
     *         however, none can be equipped. 

   Examples of activations for Limits include taking or dealing damage, round count,
    defeating enemies, or using a specific kind of skill multiple times.
